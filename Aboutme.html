<h1>Hello, My name Is Ricardo</h1>
<p>Im a customer service rep, with a goal of changing my career into tech.
    I've always been interested in technology. Coding to me is something 
    that never ceases to teach something new, and that to me is much more
    valuable then a normal nine to five CS job.
    <p>Apart from learning coding languages and taking Udemy Courses,
        I play yugioh in my spare time and hang out with my awesome family.
